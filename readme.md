Are you sometimes forgetting to turn on sleep timer in your (webOS-based) TV before you fall asleep? This script is for you. It runs in bacground (e.g. on Raspberry Pi) and if sees TV running it will turn it off (you can set delay).

This script uses (PyWebOSTV)[https://github.com/supersaiyanmode/PyWebOSTV] to do what it does.
